####2. It is important to choose a license for a project for multiple reasons. A license is useful for protecting the rights of the creators and developers of a project, so that external parties cannot unfairy or unjustly use or abuse any part of a project without risking legal repercussions. A license can also establish terms regarding use, warranty, and safety so that in the event of an external party seeks legal action against a project team or individual, the project team and individual are protected. A license establishes terms of acceptable use and action, so that there is little to no legal ambiguity when developers or third parties encounter problems.

####3. One should not choose to use a project without a license for multiple reasons. Using a project without a license may have been an oversight by a project's developers; meaning that one may unknowningly infringe upon privately established licensing terms. The lack of a license does not imply that one may use, modify, distribute, etc. a project or parts of a project; it is best to avoid using a project without a license so that one may avoid legal ambiguity, and hence legal issues.

####4. I agree with the claim that Gopher was severely impacted by both its licensing requirements and its choice to isolate developement to an internal group of programmers. What truly caused Gopher to fail was the reaction from its users and the public due to its decisions in not following the open source model, as well as its division and then stagnation that occured afterwards.

####5. Android devices likely use the Apache 2.0 license because Google would like to establish greater support for Android devices. Support is more likely to be established due to the Apache 2.0 license being permissive; hence allowing businesses and institutions to use, modify, and develop on Android devices without having to worry much about licensing conflicts and issues. The permissiveness of Android's licensing also encourages app developers to participate, allowing for a lively system of phone apps developers and users.

####7. For a developer, all three of the listed license are excellent choices. It is hard to say what the "best" license is, as the developer may have different goals or ideas about the progression and purpose of the project. Personally, I favor the LGPL for libraries and the GPL for software.

####  For a company, the best license choice would probably be the Apache License; as this license seems to protect and serve the company interests. The Apache License is a logical choice for a company, as it encourages use, modification, and distribution of the company products.

####  For the common good, the most permissive license would be the best choice. Personally, I favor the MIT license for this option, but as it is not a choice, I would say one of the GNU licenses would be the best for the "common good".

####9. I have been interested in exploring and utilizing psuedo-random number generating and noise generating algorithms. I would like to create something that is procedurally generated, yet looks "natural". I do not have any target audience in mind, but those who would be interested in this project would also probably be interested in learning about the concepts used. I would probably use the MIT license, or a similarly permissive license depending on future circumstances.
