2. It is important to choose a license for a project for multiple reasons. A license is useful for protecting the rights of the creators and developers of a project, so that external parties cannot unfairy or unjustly use or abuse any part of a project without risking legal repercussions. A license can also establish terms regarding use, warranty, and safety so that in the event of an external party seeks legal action against a project team or individual, the project team and individual are protected. A license establishes terms of acceptable use and action, so that there is little to no legal ambiguity when developers or third parties encounter problems.

3. One should not choose to use a project without a license for multiple reasons. Using a project without a license may have been an oversight by a project's developers; meaning that one may unknowningly infringe upon privately established licensing terms. The lack of a license does not imply that one may use, modify, distribute, etc. a project or parts of a project; it is best to avoid using a project without a license so that one may avoid legal ambiguity, and hence legal issues.

4. I agree with the claim that Gopher was severely impacted by both its licensing requirements and its choice to isolate developement to an internal group of programmers. What truly caused Gopher to fail was the reaction from its users and the public due to its decisions in not following the open source model, as well as its division and then stagnation that occured afterwards.

5. Android devices likely use the Apache 2.0 license because Google would like to establish greater support for Android devices. Support is more likely to be established due to the Apache 2.0 license being permissive; hence allowing businesses and institutions to use, modify, and develop on Android devices without having to worry much about licensing conflicts and issues. The permissiveness of Android's licensing also encourages app developers to participate, allowing for a lively system of phone apps developers and users.
